# DogWhisprr

DogWhisprr is an app designed to aid in the fight against dog's being put down in shelters. This app allows not only pounds/animal shelters to post dogs that need saved, but the users aswell. 

# HOW IT WAS MADE
This app was made predominately with Ruby on Rails, and uses basic HTML in the erb files. It was styled with Bootstrap and CSS.

# HOW TO USE

DogWhisprr is a pretty simple app to understand. If you are not logged in, your home page will be the log in page, and you will not be able to view the dog's index. If you are logged in it takes you to the main dog index, and you can look through the list of dogs, and decide which you want adopted. Once you select "adopt", that dog will be hidden from the index. You also have the ability to add a dog you want to put up to the list of dogs. You can also view and edit your profile, which is accessible in the nav-bar.
