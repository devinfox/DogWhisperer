# HOW TO USE

DogWhisprr has a simplistic modern approach to the layout. If you are not logged in, your "home" page will be the log in page, and you will not be able to view the dog's index. If you are logged in, your "home" page takes you to the main dog catalog, & allows you to look through your selection. Once you select "adopt", that dog will be removed from the index. You also have the ability to add your own dog that you want to put up on the catalog. If you ever need to make any changes to your profile, simply click "my profile" in the nav bar, and at the bottom of the screen select "edit profile".
